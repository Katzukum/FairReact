*   **Primary Logo:** The full-color logo with the wordmark is the preferred version for most applications.
*   **Monochrome Variations:** Black, white, and inverse variations are available for use in specific contexts (e.g., single-color printing, dark backgrounds).
*   **Minimum Clear Space:** Maintain a clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "F" in FairReact to ensure its visibility and impact.
*   **Incorrect Usage:** Avoid distorting, stretching, recoloring, or adding effects to the logo. Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds that compromise its legibility.

### 2. Color Palette

**Primary Colors:**

*   **FairReact Blue:**
    *   Hex: #007bff
    *   RGB: 0, 123, 255
*   **FairReact Purple:**
    *   Hex: #6f42c1
    *   RGB: 111, 66, 193

**Neutral Palette:**

*   **Text/Headline Gray:** A dark gray for body text and headlines to ensure readability.
*   **Background Gray:** A light gray for subtle backgrounds and UI elements.

**Usage Guidelines:**

*   The primary blue and purple should be used prominently in branding materials.
*   The gradient from blue to purple is a key visual element and should be replicated where appropriate.
*   Neutral colors support the primary palette and should be used for readability and balance.

### 3. Typography

**Primary Font: Montserrat**

*   **Headlines:** Montserrat Bold
*   **Subheadings:** Montserrat Semi-Bold
*   **Body Text:** Montserrat Regular

Montserrat is chosen for its modern, clean, and legible characteristics, which align with the brand's contemporary feel.

### 4. Imagery

*   **Style:** Imagery should be modern, clean, and often feature gradients or subtle transitions that echo the logo's aesthetic.
*   **Focus:** Images should convey innovation, connection, and user-friendliness.
*   **Examples:** Abstract shapes, technology interfaces, and dynamic compositions that incorporate the brand's color palette.

### 5. Tone of Voice

*   **Professional:** Maintain a respectful and authoritative tone.
*   **Approachable:** Be friendly and easy to understand, avoiding overly technical jargon.
*   **Innovative:** Emphasize forward-thinking solutions and modern approaches.
*   **Trustworthy:** Build confidence through clear, consistent, and reliable communication.
